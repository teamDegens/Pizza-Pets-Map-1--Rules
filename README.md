Pizza pets map #1 rules 

Welcome to the ultimate Pizza Pets strategy map. The objective of the game is to eliminate your opponents pets or blow up their doughjo with a Lava Cactus Bomb, this map is played 1v1 and each player has 5 pizza pets. This game mode combines catan, candy land, chess, search and destroy from call of duty and many more. Bringing the best aspects of each game together with a twist of course; to create a unique experience while playing. 

There are seven resources located around the map equally accessible to both sides and each pet is associated with a specific resource.



Each turn consists of first moving the Pizza Pets then performing an action such as: making a bridge, making a Lava Cactus Bomb, making arrows for your turret and so much more! 

The game starts with the person that initiated the game going first. The first person rolls the 2 dice (each dice is labeled 1-6) and whatever numbers on the dice each one of their pets can move that many spaces. 

Note: moving can not go diagonal only left right up and down 



If you are collecting resources/building/using items it will end the movement for that pet for that turn. Each pet can only do one action per turn.



Towers/Special blocks:

Dough-Jo turret- 3 block range (1.5 hearts damage per turn, 50% ammo per turn, 100% ammo max) 

Small Turret- 2 block range (1 heart damage per turn, 50% ammo per turn, 100% ammo max) 

Quicksand- takes you to your ninja or to your side of the quicksand (going to the dessert from home base you will land on the outer space of the quicksand on your side) (you can go through your opponents portal to get to their base)

Notes: 
- If your pet is boosted for that element you will get double the materials. You collect 1 base so double is 2. 

- All materials per player that are collected will go to a central backpack and items can’t be used on the turn you collect them. 

- The turret starts with 0% arrows. Each turret can only hold 100% arrows and uses 50% arrows per turn when opponent is in the area. 

- You can not be on the same space so in the same turn 2 pets can not use the same portal as they would be on the same block 

- Teleporting also ends your turn and counts as your action 

- You have to be able to take the damage from the turret to do any action such as placing the bomb

- All attacks happen on opponents turn so if you make a shield and then get close to a turret; the shield will be in affect when turret does damage

- turret can’t be reloaded on the same turn it’s moved as it would not be there yet based on blocks 

- you teleport to the mythical forest block in your openers base
